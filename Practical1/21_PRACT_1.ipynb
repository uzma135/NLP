We can do multitasking while listening to the critical file data. Python provides many APIs to convert text to speech. The Google Text to Speech API is popular and commonly known as the gTTS API.\n","The gTTS API provides the facility to convert text files into different languages such as English, Hindi, German, Tamil, French, and many more. We can also play the audio speech in fast or slow mode.
